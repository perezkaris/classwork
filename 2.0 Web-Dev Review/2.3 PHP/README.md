## Aim 🏹
- Recap of PHP Fundamentals
  - Using PHP in HTML
  - Variables
  - Operators

  - Printing out text

- We will do this in the following steps 🚶 ;
  - Create the following files; “greeter.php”, “greeter.css”.
  - Add a textbox (with a label ‘Age’) and a button(Salimia Me).
  - Include the css file and style the textbox and label.
  - The textbox should only accept numbers, if any other type is entered, show a popup warning the user to enter numbers only.
  - Write a PHP function that takes age as its input and returns “Child” if 12 and below, “Teenie” if between 13 and 19, “Yout” if less than 30 otherwise “Mzito”.
  - Display a styled message once the button is clicked.
